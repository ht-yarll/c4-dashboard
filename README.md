# Blackstone GBQ

this is a study project with data analysis focus. The objective is to use google APIS and tools to manipulate data and create dashboards

## Used Libraries

 - [Pandas üêº](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)
 - [Google BigQuery ‚ò±](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs)
 - [Google Cloud Storage ‚òÅÔ∏è](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs)


## Roadmap
- [x] ~**Set up Google Cloud Permissions and Access** for Cloud Storage and BigQuery.~
- [x] ~**Create a script** to retrieve data from a folder and upload it to Cloud Storage.~
- [x] ~**Write a script** to fetch the data from Cloud Storage, process it with Python, and upload it to a BigQuery dataset.~
- [ ] **Use SQL** to query and transform the dataset in BigQuery, ensuring the data is properly prepared for visualization.
- [ ] **Connect the data** to Looker Studio to build an interactive dashboard.
- [ ] **Design and organize the dashboard** using Figma or a similar tool to enhance its visual appeal and usability.
- [ ] **Finalize the dashboard**, adding all necessary components, and create a comprehensive presentation to showcase it effectively.


## Key Takeaways

**Cloud Storage and BigQuery**: Efficient storage and processing of large volumes of data.  

**Data Formats (Parquet)**: Advantages in terms of performance and compression.
