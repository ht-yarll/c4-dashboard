# Blackstone GBQ

this is a study project with data analysis focus. The objective is to use google APIS and tools to manipulate data and create dashboards

## Used Libraries

 - [Pandas 🐼](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)
 - [Google BigQuery ☱](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs)
 - [Google Cloud Storage ☁️](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs)


## Roadmap
- **Set up Google Cloud Permissions and Access** for Cloud Storage and BigQuery.
- **Create a script** to retrieve data from a folder and upload it to Cloud Storage.
- **Write a script** to fetch the data from Cloud Storage, process it with Python, and upload it to a BigQuery dataset.
- **Use SQL** to query and transform the dataset in BigQuery, ensuring the data is properly prepared for visualization.
- **Connect the data** to Looker Studio to build an interactive dashboard.
- **Design and organize the dashboard** using Figma or a similar tool to enhance its visual appeal and usability.
- **Finalize the dashboard**, adding all necessary components, and create a comprehensive presentation to showcase it effectively.


## Key Takeaways

**Cloud Storage and BigQuery**: Efficient storage and processing of large volumes of data.  

**Data Formats (Parquet)**: Advantages in terms of performance and compression.  

**Dashboard Design**: UX/UI principles applied to dashboards.  

**BI Tools**: Real-time data connection and visualization.
